### Deliverables

[x] As a user, I should be able to type a task into the input field.
[x] a user, I should be able to click some form of a submit button.
[x] As a user, I expect to see the task string that I provided appear in the DOM
  after the submit button has been activated.

### Stretch Deliverables

Once you've got the required deliverables working, you may want to try to
implement one or more of the following:

[x] A delete function that will remove tasks from your list
* A priority value selected from a [dropdown][] that is used to determine the color
  of the text in the list (e.g. red for high priority, yellow for medium, green
  for low)
  * As an additional challenge, implement a sorting functionality that displays
    the tasks in ascending or descending order based on priority
* An additional input field (e.g. user, duration, date due)
[x] Ability to edit tasks
* Something of your choice! The main objective is to add a feature that allows
  the user's input to affect the DOM
